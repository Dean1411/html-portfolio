            <h3>Good Fellas</h3>
            <p>
                I love Italian movies due to their principles, strategies, and how organized they are in certain things.

            <h3>Friday</h3>
            <p>
                I love this movie because I can relate to it. Itâ€™s based on a day in the ghetto and what can happen at any time. So it's best to be aware of your surroundings at all times.
