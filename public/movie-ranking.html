<h3>Good Fellas</h3>
<p>
I love italian movies due to they're principals they have, they're strategies and how organized they are in certain things.

<h3>Friday</h3>
<p>
I love this movies because I can relate to it. As the movie is based on a day in the ghetto and what can happen at anytime. So it's best to be aware of your surroundings at all time.
